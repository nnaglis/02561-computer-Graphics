# 02561-computer-Graphics

This repository contains the code for the course 02561 Computer Graphics at the Technical University of Denmark.

## Technologies Used
 - WebGL
 - GLSL (for the shaders)
 - JavaScript (for the logic)
 - HTML (for the UI)

## Course Objectives
 - Use application programming interface (e.g. WebGL) to develop a graphics application
 - Accessing graphics hardware using shader languages (e.g. GLSL)
 - Creating 3D scene with different objects, light sources, and materials
 - Using different camera types
 - Scene interactivity
 - Model-light-material interaction
 - Surface details using textures, bump mapping.
 - Environment mapping
 - Shadows
 - Specualar highlights
  
## Running the code

Code can be executed by using *Live Server* extension on Visual Studio Code and opening each of the HTML files in the browser.

## Example Images

## Shell based texturing (Extra Project)

![](/Project/shell_texturing.gif)

Shell texturing allows to create an object with a texture that is not a simple image, but a combination of multiple images. This technique allows to create a more convincing look for a furry/fuzzy object (or in this case - grass) without the need to model each individual hair.

More details can be found in the [Project folder](/Project).
