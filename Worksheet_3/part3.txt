    In part 1 following transformations were used:
        Projection transformation (camera to clip space) 
        Camera transformation(camera position and rotation)
    Resulting in the following CTM:
        CTM = P * C

    In part 2 following transformations were used:
        Projection transformation (camera to clip space) -> ortho()
        Camera transformation(camera position and rotation) -> lookAt()
        Model transformation (cube position and rotation) -> translate() and applyRotation( translate() rotate() translate() )
    Resulting in the following CTM:
        CTM = P * C * M
    and finally the resulting cube is transformed again so that it is not in the center of the screen:
        CTM * T
