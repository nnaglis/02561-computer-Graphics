Explanation of surface normals calculation:
    Surface normals are obtained by multiplying the inverse of the transpose of the modelview matrix by the normal vector of each vertex.
    It is necessary to invert and transpose the modelview matrix to keep the normals perpendicular to the surface of the object when the object is scaled  non-uniformly.

    it relates to surface smoothness because the normal vector is used to calculate the amount of light reflected off of the surface of the object. As it is done on a per
    fragment basis, the normal vector is therefore interpolated, resulting in a smooth looking surface.
